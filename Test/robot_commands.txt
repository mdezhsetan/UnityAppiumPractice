# To run all test cases in a folder: (Test a a name of the folder which includes all testcases)
    robot Tests

# To run all tests in a folder randomly:
    robot --randomize All Tests


# To run special test cases:

** In this case we have to use [Tags] in the code

    robot -i tag1 Test

** To use multiple tags we can use this operators:
    tag1ANDtag2
    tag1ORtag2

# To change log:

    robot --loglevel INFO Test  //default log of robot framework
    robot --loglevel DEBUG Test //more information about all the keywords that executed
    robot --loglevel TRACE Test //a lot more information than DEBUG

# To put output into the certain location

    robot -d [here we can write the name of the folder into the current folder or address another destination from current folder] Test
