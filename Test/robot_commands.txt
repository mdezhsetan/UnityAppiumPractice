# To run tests together:
    robot Test1.robot Test2.robot

# To run all test cases in a folder: (Test a a name of the folder which includes all testcases)
    robot Tests

# To run all tests in a folder randomly:
    robot --randomize All Tests


# To run special test cases:

** In this case we have to use [Tags] in the code

    robot -i tag1

** To use multiple tags we can use this operators:
    tag1ANDtag2
    tag1ORtag2

# To change log:

    robot --loglevel INFO Test  //default log of robot framework
    robot --loglevel DEBUG Test //more information about all the keywords that executed
    robot --loglevel TRACE Test //a lot more information than DEBUG

# To put output into the certain location

    robot -d [here we can write the name of the folder into the current folder or address another destination from current folder] Test

# To define variables we have to out them into ***Variables*** header

    ${my_variable_name}     this is variable value
    @{my_list_name}     value1  value2  value3
    &{my_dictionary+name}       key1=VALUE1  key2= VALUE2

** To use the defined variables we can use :   ${name of the defined variable,list, dictionary}


# To Assign multiple
    ${a}    ${b}    ${c} =    Get Three
    ${first}    @{rest} =    Get Three
    @{before}    ${last} =    Get Three
    ${begin}    @{middle}    ${end} =    Get Three

** Assuming that the keyword 'Get Three' returns a list [1, 2, 3], the following variables are created:
    ${a}, ${b} and ${c} with values 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
    ${first} with value 1, and @{rest} with value [2, 3].
    @{before} with value [1, 2] and ${last} with value 3.
    ${begin} with value 1, @{middle} with value [2] and ${end} with value 3.

** It is an error if the returned list has more or less values than there are scalar variables to assign.
** Additionally, only one list variable is allowed and dictionary variables can only be assigned alone.



# To use keywords:

    *** Keywords ***
    Log a Username
