pyTest file convention:
        File name :  test_*.py or *test.py
        Class name:  should start with Tes

Run from terminal:
        python -m pytest      //runs all the tests (with the mantioned convention)
                                ... in the directory and subdirectory of the current folder
                Example:        write @pytest.mark.first before a test_* method
                                use command: py.test -m one

        py.test OR pytest     //runs our test
        pytest -v             // it runs with verbouse flag and shows more detail
        pytest filename.py    //runs the file mentioned in the directory

        py.test -k   [a substring to match the test function names] -v
